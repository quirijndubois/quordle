Just a simple Django project to test some networking and interactivity stuff. The main focus of the project was to build some protection against cheating (the original Wordle literally saves the answer in a string variable, which is viewable to end users). I also added some user detection stuff, so that you cant restart by going to a different tab or even switching browser or clearing cookies.
